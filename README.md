# Hi There!
My name is Andy Williams, a recent Master's Degree recipient looking to break into a data science career, and all that can entail. My education has exposed me to a variety of data analysis environments, such as Python, SQL, Excel, R, and SAS. When I can, I program in R, for it both easy to use and very, very flexible!

My school projects have had a range of topics as well, but my focus has always been on the "shape" of the data rather than the topic itself. I enjoy learning the topic as I go; one project I made as part of my Master's program involved a dataset of diabetic persons. As with any subject I'm unfamiliar, if I have the data already (in this case a dataset was publicly available), I start by exploring it with no insight as to what any of the numbers really mean. Patterns emerge, I think "Huh, I wonder why that looks that way,", which I then delve into scholarly articles to get a better picture of what I'm analyzing. 

It's a fun combination! Starting with a fresh perspective and checking with scholarly sources to see where my patterns fit in has been a great way to look at unfamiliar topics. It also aligns with my best skills; I like talking and working with subject experts and figuring out how my analysis skills fit into their world. 

I also make things for myself, of course. Many popular video games have public facing APIs that I will peer into and look for questions they could answer. I also like answering my probability questions by just programming simulations.

I also play a lot of board games when I can. It's been a great way to learn how to teach abstract or unfamiliar concepts to a broad range of people. I'm pretty involved in the local board game enthusiast scene, but it's become more important to me to improve how I can be more inclusive and communicate to newcomers and not rely on shorthand phrases and slang that can plague a hobby and/or industry. It's something I also did in my school work; I don't want to force the audience to wrangle with new words when the subject matter of statistics may already be overwhelming.
